SLAM TODO:

create vio and map nodes
add vio library
create infinite loop for vio
publish to /odometry

add octomap library
create subscription callbacks to /objects and /odometry

consider vio becoming just odometry using imu integration
low texture envirnement underwater is very difficult to track position in

maybe write simple line based vio from scratch? 

definetly start with just imu inegration odometry
