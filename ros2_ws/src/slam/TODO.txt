SLAM TODO:

create vio and map nodes
add vio library
create infinite loop for vio
publish to /odometry

add octomap library
create subscription callbacks to /objects and /odometry

consider vio becoming just odometry using imu integration
low texture envirnement underwater is very difficult to track position in

maybe write simple line based vio from scratch? 

definetly start with just imu inegration odometry

possible world states from map node:
    inWater
    foundGate
    throughGate
    foundMarker1
    foundMarker2
    foundMarker3
    hearPinger
    foundBuoy
    hitBuoy
    foundOctogon
    surfaced

How will boundaries be handeled?
recognize lane lines?
how will we see the floor?
not run into wall?
ultrasound sensors?

Octomap:

utilize ColorOcTree for semantic object information?
each type of object can be represented as a different color

octomap roadmap: 
implement using rgbd data from gazebo sim
experiment with implementing specific types of objects into the map, not just occupancy infomation
    - ml node needed? 
    - use generic yolov8 until ml team has something?
implement scan source updating (odometry)
    - subscrube to /odeometry
    - create variable for scan start point (most recent odeomtry value)

how will distances of objects be handeled if we have no stereo camera?
manually updating batches of nodes based on ml output and distance estimates?

is 3d mapping required, can we get by without using it? 
maybe but its probably not worth it
