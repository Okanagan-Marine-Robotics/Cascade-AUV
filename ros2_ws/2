SLAM TODO:

create vio and map nodes
add vio library
create infinite loop for vio
publish to /odometry

add octomap library
create subscription callbacks to /objects and /odometry

consider vio becoming just odometry using imu integration
low texture envirnement underwater is very difficult to track position in

maybe write simple line based vio from scratch? 

definetly start with just imu inegration odometry

possible world states from map node:
    inWater
    foundGate
    throughGate
    foundMarker1
    foundMarker2
    foundMarker3
    hearPinger
    foundBuoy
    hitBuoy
    foundOctogon
    surfaced

How will boundaries be handeled?
recognize lane lines?
how will we see the floor?
not run into wall?
ultrasound sensors?

Octomap:

utilize ColorOcTree for semantic object information?
each type of object can be represented as a different color
