SLAM TODO:

implement IMU integration
test ORBSLAM_3 again? will probably be better than imu alone

directly add depth map to octomap (using rgbd and absolute pose data from gazebo)

use multiple kinds of maps?
raw + semantic

raw used for collision avoidance, sematic used for navigation

search for vio library
create infinite loop for vio
publish to /odometry

maybe write simple line based vio from scratch? 

start with just imu inegration odometry

possible world states from map node:
    inWater
    foundGate
    throughGate
    foundMarker1
    foundMarker2
    foundMarker3
    hearPinger
    foundBuoy
    hitBuoy
    foundOctogon
    surfaced

How will boundaries be handeled?
recognize lane lines?
how will we see the floor?
not run into wall?
ultrasound sensors?

Octomap:

utilize ColorOcTree for semantic object information?
each type of object can be represented as a different color

octomap roadmap: 
implement using rgbd data from gazebo sim
experiment with implementing specific types of objects into the map, not just occupancy infomation
    - ml node needed? 
    - use generic yolov8 until ml team has something?

how will object location confidences be updated
store address of every leaf node of a certain type (ex. all gate nodes)

use robot_localization or orbslam3 pose as absolute pose
maybe both? convert orbslam3 pose to odometry and then integrate it with the imu data using robot_localization?
