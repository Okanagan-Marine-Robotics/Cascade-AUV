Navigation TODO:

create subscribtion callback to /destination
create a* search function?

some form of progress tracking is important
compare imu movement readings to expected path, if there is a large disparity 
(not moving at all while supposed to be moving forward)
then an error can be thrown and the sub can try to move back and restart its path
useful if perhaps the sub gets hooked on gate or something similar
